It is used to create workflows that run tasks and other jobs in a sequence of steps. Airflow users can organize their jobs into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to define the order of execution and create dependencies between jobs. Airflow also provides tools for monitoring, retrying, and alerting when jobs fail.",
