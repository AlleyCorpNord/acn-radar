title: Medplum
description: Medplum is a headless EHR that makes it easier to build healthcare
  apps quickly with less code.
opinion: >-
  * Headless [FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir) server that allows implementation of
  custom EHR apps quickly

  * Awesome Authentication & Authorization model that:

    * can map authentication from different external identity providers (Auth0, Google, Clerk...)
    * means that you don't need to create a proxy in front of the server - it can be used directly from the front-end
  * Small company, very knowledgeable and responsive

  * The FHIR spec is not entirely supported, and it is sometime hard to know what works and what does not, particularly around the search

  * [Open-source codebase](https://github.com/medplum/medplum) that is easy to read and tinker with; TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS CDK

  * See also: [BonFHIR](https://bonfhir.dev/)
