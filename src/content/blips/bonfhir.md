title: bonFHIR
description: Open-source TypeScript library aimed at simplifying the development
  of applications that use [FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/).
opinion: >-
  bonFHIR allows easy development of healthcare tech applications that use the
  [FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/) standard.


  In conjunction with a server such as [Medplum](https://radar.alleycorpnord.com/blips/medplum), it can be used to create web, mobile, and backend application quickly and easily.


  It covers the following features:


  * FHIR client (REST & GraphQL)

  * Resources & Data types manipulation

  * Localized formatters

  * React state management (using React Query)

  * [React UI Components](https://bonfhir.dev/storybook)

  * FHIR Subscriptions (with support for AWS Lambda)

  * Custom FHIR Resources

  * Code generation

  * CLI

  * â€¦ and many more!


  It is easy to get started and saves a lot of time at the inception of a FHIR project, allowing the team to focus on app features instead of initial plumbing.
