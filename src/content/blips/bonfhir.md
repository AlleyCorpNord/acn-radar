title: BonFHIR
description: >-
  BonFHIR is a collection of open-source building blocks (technically NPM packages) that can be used to create products and solutions based on the [HL7 FHIR](https://fhir.org/) standard.  The vision of the team behind it is to become the equivalent of [retool](https://retool.com/) for FHIR.  
opinion: >-
  It allows you to save a lot of time and reuse boilerplate code (Ex:  Formatters).  A team working on a health-tech project can save up to 6 months of work by leveraging bonfhir.  
  
  
  As of Jul 2023 it is still in beta release and therefore lacking maturity and documentation.
  

  Also note that onboarding and integrating the framework at this moment still requires some advanced engineering and architecture knowledge.  The team is working on simplifying the adoption and the requiried technical entry level.
