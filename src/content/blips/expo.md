description: >-
  Expo is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build and deploy iOS and Android apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.  They have an open source platform and a set of commercial cloud application services built on top of it.  
opinion: >-
  It has the following strengths:
  
  - They have vetted libraries that are guaranteed to work with your product

  - They can handle the building and packaging lifecycles of native apps

  - They simplify the process to submit new builds to the appstore

  - They support "Over the air" deploymentss when no native changes are needed (Ex:  new labels, image changes within the app, etc.) therefore aoviding the submission to the app stores altogether

  - They have "Expo Go" which is an open-source client for testing React Native apps on Android and iOS devices without building anything locally.  It allows you to open up apps served through Expo CLI and run your projects faster when developing them.


  It has the following weaknesses:

  - It limits the choice of libraries as they have to be compatible with the expo framework (Developers can still open PRs on their open source code to add support for new libraries)
