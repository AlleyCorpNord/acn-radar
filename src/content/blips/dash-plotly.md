title: Dash (Plotly)
description: >
  Dash is a low-code framework to build dashboards using the scientific
  visualization library Plotly. Dash creates React applications from code
  written in Python, Julia, R or F#.
opinion: >-
  Using Dash gives a lot of advantages:

  * very customizable regarding types of plots (Ex: Scientific, Finance, use-case specific)

  * supports complex data visualizations (timeseries, 3D, etc.)

  * interactive graphs and tables using React components

  * can be embedded within your own API and return html page with react components

  * Free version available


  One drawback of using Dask is that some complex cases could require more support that is not provided with the free version. The enterprise offering includes enterprise features (security, RBAC, visualization workload management, etc.) and support but the pricing is not published on the website.


  It is better to use Dash when you need domain-specific customizations (Machine Learning/Data Science for example). Indeed, for pure analytics reports and dashboards, it is better to go to most established tools like Looker, Tableau, Metabase, etc.
