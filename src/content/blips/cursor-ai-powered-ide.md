title: "Cursor: AI powered IDE"
description: >-
  Cursor is an AI-first code editor designed to enhance software development
  speed, particularly through AI-assisted pair-programming. It provides various
  features that significantly speed up engineering tasks. Key functionalities
  include:


  * Chat with Your Project: Tailored answers and guidance about your codebase, helping you quickly find starting points for changes or specific methods.

  * Reference Files and Docs: Direct access to documentation, code definitions, and files.

  * Code Changes Assistance: AI helps write low-level logic and allows editing or generating code through simple prompts.

  * Bug Detection and Fixing: Cursor automatically scans for bugs and helps identify their root causes.

  * Familiar and Secure: It's a fork of VSCode, allowing one-click migration of extensions, themes, and keybindings, with a privacy mode ensuring code privacy

  **Pros**:


  * Cursor notably speeds up coding, making it a valuable tool for building MVPS

  * The ability edit code blocks by selecting it and hitting command + K is very powerful, because you can clearly described what how you want to code to change, and then review those changes before committing to them.

  * The AI has access to any file in the code base. The context that this brings makes it much more effective.

  * You can reference documentation to give it further context, and if documentation is missing, you can add the documentation's URL and save it to your IDE

  * Debugging features of Cursor significantly reduce time spent on identifying and fixing errors.

  * Cursor reduces the time you spend searching for specific syntax or terms, making it easier to learn and work with unfamiliar programs or libraries.

  * The 'command K' feature allows for explicit instructions to the AI, minimizing time lost due to incorrect AI-generated solutions

  * The AI assistant, accessible with 'command + L', provides full context of the working file and can be extended to the entire codebase, including relevant documentation. This acts as a very effective pair programmer

  * The 'control + option + Enter' command offers the entire codebase as context. Ex. if you want to fetch data from the frontend, and the API exists in the same repo, you can give it context to the whole code base and it will identify the code it needs to reference in the frontend.

  * Cursor also promotes better developer comprehension, as it requires articulating intentions in English, similar to pair programming or the "rubber duck" debugging method.




  **Cons**:


  * Cursor overrides some key commands, so you may have to slightly change your habits (or custom configure your commands).

  * Every once in a while a function of Vscode, or a plugin you are used to using may not work, but I have found this not to be a huge problem because Cursor's AI features bring so much automation.

  * This could encourage you to pass over details of the implementation, so it is important to slow down and make sure you understand the changes that are being made so you do not lose understanding, or any learning moments


  In conclusion, while there are minor drawbacks, Cursor's advanced AI capabilities and the efficiency gains it offers make it a compelling choice for enhancing our development processes. The tool's ability to streamline coding, provide quick access to information, and enhance comprehension, outweighs the minor inconveniences of adapting to its interface.
