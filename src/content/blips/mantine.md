  pros: 
    - Focused on accessibility by ensuring components are usable by everyone, including those with disabilities
    - TypeScript support
    - Rich Component Library
    - Active community
    - Familiar UI Paradigms: If you're accustomed to Material UI or Chakra UI, you'll find Mantine's design principles and components familiar and easy to adapt to.

  cons: 
    - Limited Next.js 13 Router Support: The current version(v6.0.20) of Mantine has some compatibility issues with Next.js 13's app router.
    - Upcoming Breaking Changes: The future release(v7) aimed at supporting Next.js 13 will introduce significant architectural changes, transitioning from styled-components to a Styles API. This will require code adjustments.
