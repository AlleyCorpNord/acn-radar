title: monorepo
description: >-
  A monorepo (short for "monolithic repository") is a software development approach in which multiple projects or components are stored within a single version-controlled repository. This is in contrast to the more traditional approach of using separate repositories for each project or component. In a monorepo, all the code, libraries, dependencies, and build configurations for different parts of a larger system are centralized in one place.
opinion: >-
  A monorepo facilites the following:

  - Code Reusability

  - Dependency Management
  
  - Easier Refactoring and Code Maintenance
  
  - Simplified Testing and Continuous Integration
