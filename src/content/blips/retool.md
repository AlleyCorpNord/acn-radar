  Retool is a low-code application platform that makes it easy to build custom apps, dashboards, admin panels, and other internal tools to run critical business operations.  
opinion: >-
  We believe that low-code tools dramatically accelerate the customization of business workflows and retool excels at this by allowing slightly tech users to have a good place to start building front-ends and customize their business workflows. 
  
  
  We like the fact that it supports custom components leveraging react or html+javascript.
  
  
  It is worth noting that you pay for every user of the application (both the users that build the apps referred to as:  "Standard Users" and the users that use the apps referred to as "end users" need to pay a monthly fee) so for companies with a lot of employees and potential users of each app it might be worth doing a cost analysis. However, we think that for small companies it definitely pays off.  For companies that require SSO the only option is the Enterprise version where it can get expensive.
