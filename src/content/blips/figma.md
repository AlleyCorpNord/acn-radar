title: Figma
description: Figma is a cloud-based design tool for people to create, share, and
  test designs for websites, mobile apps, and other digital products and
  experiences. It is the current best-in-class tool for product designers.
opinion: >-
  It has the following strengths:


  * Its version control of design artifacts (Paid plan) - Easy to learn and excellent documentation and tutorials

  * FigJam whiteboarding tool (included with Figma) facilitates team collaboration around Figma artifacts. However, FigJam is not as popular as Miro for collaboration between Product and Engineering as it has fewer features (but FigJam is cheaper than Miro at the time of this writing).

  * Dev Mode (new, July 2023) aims to make Figma more helpful for devs. Figma files can now be linked to Storybook, Jira and GitHub. Units are available in px or rem. 

  * Figma for VS Code extension allows devs to get code suggestions, inspect designs and post comments from their IDE: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=figma.figma-vscode-extension>


  It has the following weaknesses:


  * The way resources are organized. Currently, ACN designers use the first page to post designs that are Ready For Dev. All other pages are for work in progress.
