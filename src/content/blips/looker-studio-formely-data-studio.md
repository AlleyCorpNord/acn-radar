  Formely known as Data Studio, it is a free online tool to create analytics
  reports and dashboards.


  To use it, a Google account should be created, but there is no need of using Google Cloud Platform.
opinion: >-
  This a free reports and dashboard creation tool that has a low learning curve.
  The user can find lot of tutorials on Youtube showing how to use different
  components. The tool integrates well with various data sources, especially
  BigQuery. When used with BigQuery, the data source provider could create a BI
  Engine in Google Cloud that can take the load of executing BigQuery jobs and
  speed up the generation of the reports.


  However, there are some negative aspects to consider:


  * the fixed frame size limits real estate to visualize the report

  * It was hard to generate and customize reports with multi-level groups

  * there is a limited offering in terms of visualization components


  Therefore the tool should be limited to simple dashboards and reports that do not require complex joins and aggregations.
