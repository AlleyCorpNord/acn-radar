  The **Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources'** (**FHIR**, pronounced
  "fire") standard is a set of rules and specifications for exchanging
  electronic health care data. It is designed to be flexible and adaptable, so
  that it can be used in a wide range of settings and with different health care
  information systems. The goal of FHIR is to enable the seamless and secure
  exchange of health care information, so that patients can receive the best
  possible care. The standard describes data formats and elements (known as
  "resources") and an application programming interface (API) for exchanging
  electronic health records (EHR). The standard was created by the Health Level
  Seven International (HL7) health-care standards organization.

opinion: >-
  We believe that a standards based approach for managing Electronic Health
  Record data exchange is key to drive innovation and acceleration in the Health
  industry.  This specification is gaining big momentum due to its adoption by
  big tech companies (Ex:  apple [health
  app](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/01/apple-announces-effortless-solution-bringing-health-records-to-iPhone/),
  microsoft [FHIR
  service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir/overview)
  in Azure Health Data Services, and google FHIR support in its [Cloud
  Healthcare
  API](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/how-tos/fhir-resources)).  Although
  the legislation and regulations being adopted in the US (See: [Policies and
  Technology for Interoperability and Burden
  Reduction](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/interoperability/index))
  are making FHIR compliance mandatory and accelerating its implementation in
  Europe there is a competition with  [Open EHR](https://openehr.org/).
