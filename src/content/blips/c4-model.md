title: C4 Model
description: The C4 model is a way of describing and communicating software architecture.
opinion: >-
  The C4 model promotes a **simple** but effective way of representing software
  architecture.


  It suggests to use basic diagrams with simple notation (e.g., box and arrows), and do not get bogged down by unnecessary details or formalism (looking at you, UML).


  It is oriented towards implementation and concrete artifacts (as opposed to logical representations), and is very [well documented](https://c4model.com/). The map analogy with its zoom levels is very effective to convey the purpose of each diagram.


  Creating a C4 diagram is fast, does not require many hours of training, and is understandable by the non-initiated.


  [There are a number of tools](https://c4model.com/#Tooling) that can help you get started with this representation; they range from code representation ([Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/c4.html), [PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML)…) to visual editors ([Figma](https://www.figma.com/templates/c4-model-examples/), [Miro](https://miro.com/miroverse/c4-architecture/)…).


  Along with [ADRs](/blips/adr), they can form a pretty good baseline to efficiently document software architecture.
